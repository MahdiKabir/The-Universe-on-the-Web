This is a rough idea, so please do change things here! - Nahiyan

1. Header picture. Something stylish, like a picture overlooking the Earth or the Sun. A caption for the image.
2. Introduction to the project, the universe and the scientific advances in the past age and what's to come.
3. Table of contents. Possibly aligned to the right to allow space for other content.
4. History.
5. Overall layout of the universe, from planets, to planetary systems, to solar systems, to galaxies, to galactic clusters, the Virgo supercluster, the observable universe.
6. Technology as tools for astronomy. History, current, future. Map of all planets with their exploratory satellites & probes. A list of observatory telescopes satellites. Communication networks (Deep Space Network/DSN. http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsnnow/)
7. Gallery of planets. Click a planet to show its picture, description, small facts (mass, orbital distance, etc.) in a table and other details such as number of objects orbitting it.
8. The milky way, the orbital mechanics playing in, supermassive blackhole at the centre, the role of dark matter (how dark matter was deduced to exist -- observed orbital speeds of stars from x distance do not match with predicted speeds). Lastly, other galaxies in comparison?
9. Galactic clusters.
10. Credits, footer. Possibly some very inspirational quotes.
